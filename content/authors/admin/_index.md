I am an Assistant Professor and TBO Group Faculty Fellow in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi. I am also closely associated with the Amar Nath and Shashi Khosla School of Information Technology, and the newly formed Yardi School of Artificial Intelligence. Before IIT Delhi, I have worked for 2.5 years at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS)](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) as a post-doctoral researcher. My PhD was from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), where I was jointly advised by [Prof. Niloy Ganguly](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ernet.in/~niloy/) from IIT Kharagpur and [Prof. Krishna Gummadi](https://www.mpi-sws.org/~gummadi/) from MPI-SWS. During PhD, I was awarded the prestigious [Prime Minister's Fellowship for Doctoral Research](http://primeministerfellowshipscheme.in/) and [Google India PhD Fellowship](https://sites.google.com/site/indiacsprograms/phd-fellowships).
